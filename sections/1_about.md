  Colouring In is a collaborative research project by [Dr Stephanie
  Black](https://www.kingston.ac.uk/staff/profile/dr-stephanie-black-1216/)
  (Kingston School of Art) and [Dr Luise
  Vormittag](https://www.arts.ac.uk/colleges/camberwell-college-of-arts/people/luise-vormittag)
  (Camberwell College of Arts, UAL), through which we are examining the impact
  of illustration on themes of critical importance to global debates.


  We are taking a cross-disciplinary approach to look specifically at the intersection of illustration with other areas and disciplines, as we focus on shared concerns such as the natural world, urbanism or remembrance and identity construction.


  We are interested in discovering more about the impact illustration currently has in these areas and the possibilities of critical illustration practice to make meaningful interventions.


  The PDF publications on this website are working papers – an initial insight into our research that we will develop into a more fully realised publication at a later stage. We invite you to write to us with your thoughts, feedback and references to innovative work that might enrich these discussions.
