  What are truthful images? How can illustration – which often takes the form of
  fabricated pictures – carry the burden of truth? What kinds of reality do we
  expect illustration to show us?


  \

  In this fourth (and final) issue of *Colouring In*, we plunge into a hugely engaging exploration of how illustration practice intersects and overlaps with notions of truthfulness: From the subjective truth of drawing on site, to illustration as evidence; from the challenges of running a picture desk to illustrations circumnavigating censorship, the knotty questions just kept coming. In spite of the countless challenges of our post-truth era we draw hope from illustration’s capacity to conjure shared and relatable worlds. Here’s to us illustrators!
