  Call for papers!


  Issue #3 of Colouring In will emerge from a generative one-day in-person symposium in November 2022. Colouring In: The Past is concerned with illustrative strategies that unearth, activate and re-position our relationship to the past. We invite paper or panel proposals on relevant topics, including, but not limited to the themes below. One panel within the day’s schedule will be comprised of papers arising from this call. We are keen to extend the invitation to non-illustrators whose research is concerned with the creation and use of images (and other visual matter) in relation to the past. 


  The symposium will take place in person at Chelsea College of Arts, UAL, London, UK. We are happy to consider online presentations if travel is not possible for individual speakers, but we very much encourage on-site attendance in order to fully participate in the discussion.


  Speakers will be invited to submit written-up versions of their presentations for inclusion in Issue #3 of Colouring In.
