  Call for papers: Colouring In: The Past


  Issue #3 of Colouring In will emerge from a generative one-day in-person symposium in November 2022. Colouring In: The Past is concerned with illustrative strategies that unearth, activate and re-position our relationship to the past. We invite paper or panel proposals on relevant topics, including, but not limited to the themes below. One panel within the day’s schedule will be comprised of papers arising from this call. We are keen to extend the invitation to non-illustrators whose research is concerned with the creation and use of images (and other visual matter) in relation to the past. 


  We are interested in proposals connecting the following themes and ideas to illustrative and other visual practices:


  * History & historiography: the possibilities and limitations of historiographic methods; creative approaches to historiographic bias and positionality; augmentation and fabulation, inversion and reinvention of archival documents; counter archives

  * History of illustration itself; media histories

  * Memory: subjectivity and partiality in recollection; witnessing and testimony; processes of collective memorialisation and remembrance 

  * Institutional and personal collections and archives; the accumulation of artefacts and trinkets

  * Heritage: from intangible cultural heritage to officially sanctioned and nationally celebrated manifestations; the heritage industry; the gift shop & the public-engagement workshop

  * Nostalgia: the aesthetic, emotional, social and political mobilisation of materials from the past 

  * History identity: use of the past to invent, consolidate and fracture communities

  * Illustrative representations of passing time: spatial, sequential, temporal

  * Illustration as a durational practice concerned with the recording of time

  * Cycles of fashion and the celebration of styles and artefacts from the past; sentimentality; postmodern parody and pastiche; retrofuturism

  * Falsifying traces of the past; fake vintage; customised ageing of materials and representations


  The symposium will take place in person at Chelsea College of Arts, UAL, London, UK. We are happy to consider online presentations if travel is not possible for individual speakers, but we very much encourage on-site attendance in order to fully participate in the discussion.


  Speakers will be invited to submit written-up versions of their presentations for inclusion in Issue #3 of Colouring In.
