  Motifs derived from nature can often be found in commercial illustration,
  adorning the surfaces of packaging, advertising and clothing and visually
  enriching our everyday lives. However, this isn't the only role that
  illustration can play in this regard. So what else can illustration do, in
  addition to providing visual pleasure and imparting a whiff of 'natural-ness'
  or 'wholesome-ness' to products? What other possibilities are there for
  illustration to engage with the natural world? How can illustration actually
  contribute to the creation of knowledge in this area? What are the different
  types of knowledge claims that illustration can make? 


  With Colouring In we are interested in exploring answers to these questions, and are concerned with illustrative practices that intervene within conversations concerning the natural world.
