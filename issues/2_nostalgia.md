  Cities are complex and in constant flux. How can illustration address
  something as overwhelmingly cacophonous and vast as the urban environment?
  What role can illustration play when it seeks to intervene in the fabric of
  the city itself? 


  Humans are becoming city-dwellers in increasing numbers, with over half of us worldwide living in a city today. Cities offer many ecological, cultural, economic and social benefits. However, their shortcomings are also significant, such as pollution, cost of living, quality of life and imbalances of power. In our second issue of Colouring In we tackle the relationship between illustration and the city: from street art to urban mapping, representations of fictional cities to the visual dérive, we explore illustrative strategies to draw out urban histories, reveal city dwellers’ struggles for space and visibility, and present polyvocal narratives that uphold the vitality and richness of our urban environments.
